# Simple Snake Plan
1. Create a table to represent the grid
2. Fill table with a default value of 0.5. 
3. Any place with a *hazard* set to X.
4. Any place with food set to F.
5. Any place with enemy snake set to En: where n is the number of the snake.
6. Set the head of the enemy snake to HEAD_En
6. Anywhere where near the head of an enemy snake set to -1: e.g. NEVER GO THERE
